# Predicting Students Final Grades

## Linear Regression Model
Given all the attributes to potentially help predict the students' final grades are integers, using a linear regression model to find a best-fit line between these data points seems most optimal as the data directly correlates to each other. Since this model will be multivariate, it will also be multidimensional for each attribute used in predicting the final grade.

## Predictions
To accurately predict the final grade, the first and second period grades could be used; but to make the project more interesting, these attributes will be ommitted to see if the model can accurately predict the final grade with other attributes, such as weekly alcohol consumption...
