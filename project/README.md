# Predicting Students Final Grades

## Linear Regression Model
Given all the attributes to potentially help predict the students' final grades are integers, using a linear regression model to find a best-fit line between these data points seems most optimal as the data directly correlates to each other. Since this model will be multivariate, it will also be multidimensional for each attribute used in predicting the final grade.
